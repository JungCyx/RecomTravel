Topic of discussion: 

The main target of this meeting was to discuss and delagate the functionality of the project. Prior to this, the financial app had hard coded values to display on the dashboard and 
the GUI was implemented without accepting user values. Our group will work together in peer programming to create a sql data base for each major function of the project (i.e login, budget, 
transaction, and savings). We plan to have this done by the end of today and look to then retireve the saved data to display it on the dashboard or related UI page. Additonally, one member
will be working on implementing a pie chart that takes the users data and displays in graphically.
