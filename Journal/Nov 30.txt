Todays meeting started with discussing yesterdays work. We were able to implement the database with minimal bugs and errors along with saved data for each major function.
Some problems we had while implementing the DB was failure to connect to it when running the program, and especially calling specific related functions in the mainframe in
the proper order. For example, before the user could be authenticated some functions to send and retrieve data were being called and therefore they were not mapped to a user

Todays goal it to tackle those issues as a team and meet for live paired programming around 2pm. Once handled, we plan to advance our efforts to perfect the UI and add some optional 
functionality such as using LocalDate functions and refresh buttons to display user info. Also, we are going to work on retrieving data from the user based on the assigned 
User ID and type of submission. To do this, we plan on getting the data back as an Array List and then callling the appropriate methods to get the target data 
and show the user the most current Transaction, Budget goal, and Savings goal. 

Plan for tomorrow: 
Work on the presentation and analyze the previous diagrams to ensure clarity and cooperation between them and the project;
