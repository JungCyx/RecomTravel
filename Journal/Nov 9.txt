Sprint Retrospective

User Stories TODO:
As a user, I want to see a dashboard displayed upon login with and be able to navigate to other pages so that I may update my financial information.
As a user, I want to see my monthly savings, budget, and transactional needs displayed in the dashboard so that I may visualize my monthly finances at a glance. 
As a user, I want to navigate the dashboard to reach the budget page and create a new budget so that I may efficiently allocate my monthly spending
As a user, I want to navigate the dashboard to reach the savings page and create a new savings goal so that I may effectively track/reach my monthly savings 
As a user, I want to edit/delete previous budget goals so that I may update my financial needs effectively in real time.
As a user, I want to edit/delete previous savings goals so that I may update my savings needs to reflect my current needs in real time. 


We have designated these user stories to be completed by each person by the arranged time. 

Looking to meet again on Wednesday for product review and discuss upcoming changes to previous UML diagrams to reflect changes during the process. 




Our goal is to have 30% of the code functioning by Monday 11/11/24
